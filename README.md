# SOMMELIER

Sommelier is a React-Native UI library made for WineUp. 

## Installation

The recommended workflow is to run app in one terminal:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run either Storybook or the example playground:

### Storybook

Run inside another terminal:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

### Testing

Run:

```bash
npm test
```
